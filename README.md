# HaikuGenerator
#### Does just about what you would expect

To-Do: 
 - [ ] Find a way to collect/generate dictionary words
 - [ ] Figure out how to calculate the syllables in a word (avoiding using APIs if possible)
 - [ ] Somehow check if the haiku makes any sense at all


According to [this site](http://www.syllablecount.com/syllables/longest/five_syllable_words), the longest five-syllable word in english is ~~21~~ letters long.\
According to [this site](http://www.yougowords.com/5-syllables), the longest five-syllable word in english is 15 letters long (procrastination).
According to [this site](http://www.yougowords.com/7-syllables), the longest seven-syllable word in english is 20 letters long (Buckminsterfullerene).

For dictionary word lookup, I *could* use [this library](https://pypi.org/project/PyDictionary/), but personally, that feels like cheating, so I'll leave that as a last resort.
