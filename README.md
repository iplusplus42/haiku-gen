# HaikuGenerator
#### Generates Haikus from word lists

To-Do: 
 - [x] Find a way to collect/generate dictionary words
 - [x] Figure out how to calculate the syllables in a word (avoiding using APIs if possible)
 - [ ] Somehow check if the haiku makes any sense at all
   - [ ] Create rulesets based on English grammar

The included word lists were provided to me by my professor.

~~According to [this site](http://www.syllablecount.com/syllables/longest/five_syllable_words), the longest five-syllable word in english is 21 letters long.~~
~~According to [this site](http://www.yougowords.com/5-syllables), the longest five-syllable word in english is 15 letters long (procrastination).~~
~~According to [this site](http://www.yougowords.com/7-syllables), the longest seven-syllable word in english is 20 letters long (Buckminsterfullerene).~~

~~For dictionary word lookup, I *could* use [this library](https://pypi.org/project/PyDictionary/), but personally, that feels like cheating, so I'll leave that as a last resort.~~

~~Are they real words and do they follow English grammar~~

All the crossed out lines above have been resolved by my use of word lists.
